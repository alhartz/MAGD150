# My Projects

I created these projects my Freshman year for my MAGD150 course using Processing 3.4

## Space Project

[Lab 2](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab02_hartz.pde) is the second project that I completed using Processing.
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to a space theme and use the RGB, HEX, and HSB color modes. We were also supposed to use three different compositional elements. I incorporated triangles, arcs, and the beginShape functions.

Even though this was one of my first and most simple projects, I really like how it turned out. I love the colors that I used, and I am very proud of this project as a whole.

## Ocean Project

[Lab 4](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab04_hartz.zip) is the fourth project that I completed in my MAGD150 course.
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to an ocean theme. I was also instructed to incorporate the mousePressed and keyPressed functions, at least 3 if-else statements, and a loop.

This project required me to integrate more interactability into my project with the mousePressed and keyPressed functions. I made it so that when you press with the mouse, it creates an ellipse that looks like bubbles using the onion skin effect with a slightly transparent background. I forgot to include a For/While loop in this project, but overall I enjoyed how this project turned out, I just wish that I had given myself more time so I could've made it look more visually appealing. 

## Television Project

[Lab 5](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab05_hartz.zip) is the fifth project that I created using Processing. 
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to a television theme. This project required me to make it much more interactable than I ever had in my previous projects. I had to make circular and rectangular buttons that performed an action when clicked with the mouse, and label them with text.

My buttons changed the color of the TVâ€” the power button turned the screen black, and the circular button made the screen white. On top of the screen I created an infinite amount of greyscale ellipses to give the screen a TV static effect.I really like how this project turned out, and it is one of my favorite assingments I completed in this course.


## Screensaver Project

[Lab 6](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18_magd150_lab06_hartz.zip) is the sixth project that I created using Processing.
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to a screensaver theme. This project was a little different than the other projects I worked on in this class because it did not require me to create a specific type of scene, and was a lot more abstract and open ended. I was required to create and call on my own original functions, and construct my own class.

I  made it so that you can "erase" a portion of my screensaver by clicking and holding on the screen. When this happens, the path of the screensaver is erased from most of the screen, and when you unclick, the path starts fresh. I enjoy the colors used in this project, and I think it is pretty cool how you can reset the screensaver if it starts to cover too much of the screen.


## Transformation Project

[Lab 7](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab07_hartz.zip) is the seventh project that I created using Processing.
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to a nature theme. I was also required to create and use 3 PVectors, along with 3 PVector functions, as well as to incorporate the rotate, translate, and scale transformations, and use a one or two-dimensional array. 

This project allowed me to go back to creating landscape proejects, which I am most comfortable with. I really liked how I made the sun rays move dependant on the location of my mouse on screen. I think this project is fairly visually appealing, and I like how it turned out. 


### Overall

I think that in the future I may revamp at least one of these proejects to at least make them look more visually appealing. I think it would be cool to see a before and after of my work, and see how I have improved since the beginning of the year if I was given no guidelines, but instead the freedom to do what I wanted.
