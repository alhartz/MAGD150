## My Projects

I created these projects my Freshman year for my MAGD150 course. These projects were created using Processing 3.4.

### Space Project

[Space Project](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab02_hartz.pde) is the second project that I completed using Processing.
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to a space theme and use the RGB, HEX, and HSB color modes. We were also supposed to use three different
compositional elements. I incorporated triangles, arcs, and the beginShape functions. Even though this was one of my first and most simple projects,

I really like how it turned out. I love the colors that I used, and I am very proud of this project as a whole.

### Ocean Project

[Ocean Project](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab04_hartz.zip) is the fourth project that I completed in my MAGD150 course.
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to an ocean theme. I was also instructed to incorporate the mousePressed function

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
