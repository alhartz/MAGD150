# My Projects

I created these projects my Freshman year for my MAGD150 course using Processing 3.4
## Space Project

[Lab 2](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab02_hartz.pde) is the second project that I completed using Processing.
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to a space theme and use the RGB, HEX, and HSB color modes. We were also supposed to use three different compositional elements. I incorporated triangles, arcs, and the beginShape functions.

Even though this was one of my first and most simple projects, I really like how it turned out. I love the colors that I used, and I am very proud of this project as a whole.

## Ocean Project

[Lab 4](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab04_hartz.zip) is the fourth project that I completed in my MAGD150 course.
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to an ocean theme. I was also instructed to incorporate the mousePressed and keyPressed functions, at least 3 if-else statements, and a loop.

This project required me to integrate more interactability into my project with the mousePressed and keyPressed functions. I forgot to include a For/While loop in this project, but overall I enjoyed how this project turned out, I just wish that I had given myself more time so I could've made it look more visually appealing. 

## Television Project

[Lab 5](https://github.com/alhartz/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab05_hartz.zip) is the fifth project taht I created using Processing. 
The guidelines for this project was to adhere to a television theme. This project required me to make it much more interactable than I ever had in my previous projects. I had to make circular and rectangular buttons that performed an action when clicked with the mouse, and label them with text.

My buttons changed the color of the TVâ€” the power button turned the screen black, and the circular button made the screen white. On top of the screen I created an infinite amount of greyscale ellipses to give the screen a TV static effect.I really like how this project turned out, and it is one of my favorite assingments I completed in this course.
